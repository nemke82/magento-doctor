Magento Doctor is much more than a health checker. Rather than dumping 150 disconnected warnings, Magento Doctor understands how a Magento installation is assembled and correlates code, configuration, database schema, runtime state, logs, cron/indexer behavior, and third-party modules into an **engineer-grade diagnosis**.

Evidence-First Diagnosis & Recommendations
```

Every analyzer operates against a normalized internal representation of the store rather than grep heuristics. This allows Magento Doctor to correlate facts across different subsystems to answer critical questions:

- *Does this third-party module define an around plugin on a checkout hot path that makes synchronous HTTP calls?*
- *Does a vendor cron job run every minute while having an observed median runtime of 74 seconds, creating an overlap storm?*
- *Does a collection loop execute N+1 repository loads (`$repo->getById()`) inside a loop?*
- *Which declarative schema tables or indexes are missing or redundant in the physical database?*

## Example Output

```text
Magento Doctor v2026.09.06

Magento Open Source 2.4.7-p3
Mode: production
PHP: 8.3.26
Database Host: 127.0.0.1
Modules: 312 enabled / 17 disabled
Third-party modules: 84

Overall Health: 71 / 100

CRITICAL   3
WARNING   14
INFO      22

Primary concerns

[CRITICAL] Cron backlog and overlap storm detected (MD-CRON-010)
  18,431 rows in cron_schedule
  1,922 jobs are pending beyond their expected execution window.
  87 jobs are stuck in "running".
  Oldest running job: vendor_export_feed — 3h 17m

  Evidence / Correlation:
    Vendor_Feed defines vendor_export_feed in etc/crontab.xml.
    Schedule interval: 60 seconds.
    Median runtime observed: 74 seconds.
    Overlap ratio: 1.23 (HIGH probability of overlapping executions)
    AST static analysis detected costly operations inside this job:
      - Repository Load at line 21 ($this->productRepository->getById())
      - Synchronous HTTP Request at line 28 (curl_exec())

  Impact:
    Jobs overlap faster than they complete, compounding MySQL load,
    exhausting PHP workers, and delaying core Magento indexer cron jobs.

  Recommendation:
    Reduce frequency in etc/crontab.xml, prevent overlap, move remote calls
    to queue, or optimize Vendor\Feed\Cron\Export::execute().

[CRITICAL] Around plugin on checkout hot path (MD-PLG-001)
  Plugin 'vendor_payment_quote_around' intercepts hot path 'Magento\Quote\Model\QuoteManagement'
  using an around wrapper in module 'Vendor_Payment'.

  Evidence / Correlation:
    Plugin class: Vendor\Payment\Plugin\QuoteManagement
    Intercepts: Magento\Quote\Model\QuoteManagement::submit()
    Plugin type: around (sortOrder: 10)
    Source: app/code/Vendor/Payment/etc/di.xml:4
    AST static analysis detected costly operations inside this plugin:
      - Synchronous HTTP Request at line 13 ($this->client->request())

  Impact:
    Blocking external HTTP requests during order placement directly degrades
    checkout conversion and locks customer quotes.

  Recommendation:
    Refactor around plugin to 'before' or 'after' plugin, avoid synchronous network calls,
    and ensure $proceed() is called cleanly.
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Standalone Binary (Recommended)

Pre-compiled standalone binaries are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. No PHP, Composer, or runtime dependencies required:

```bash
# Linux (x86_64)
curl -sSL https://github.com/nemke82/magento-doctor/releases/latest/download/mdoctor-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/mdoctor
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mdoctor

# Linux (musl static binary)
curl -sSL https://github.com/nemke82/magento-doctor/releases/latest/download/mdoctor-linux-amd64-musl -o /usr/local/bin/mdoctor
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mdoctor

# macOS (Apple Silicon arm64)
curl -sSL https://github.com/nemke82/magento-doctor/releases/latest/download/mdoctor-macos-arm64 -o /usr/local/bin/mdoctor
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mdoctor
```

Verify installation:
```bash
mdoctor --version
# Output: mdoctor v2026.09.06
```

### Option 2: Cargo Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/nemke82/magento-doctor mdoctor-cli
```

### Option 3: Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nemke82/magento-doctor.git
cd magento-doctor
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/mdoctor /usr/local/bin/
```

## Zero-Configuration Discovery

Magento Doctor automatically discovers the root directory by searching upward from your current working directory for `app/etc/env.php`, `config.php`, `composer.json`, and `bin/magento`:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/magento
mdoctor scan
```

You can also specify an explicit directory via `--root` or the `MAGENTO_ROOT` environment variable:
```bash
mdoctor --root /var/www/magento scan
# or
MAGENTO_ROOT=/var/www/magento mdoctor scan
```

---

### Configuration Drift & Baseline Comparison

Track store evolution, detect unauthorized configuration drift, and catch regressions before and after production deployments:

```bash
# 1. Create a baseline snapshot before deploying or upgrading
mdoctor baseline create --output mdoctor-baseline.json

# 2. Deploy your changes or update extensions...

# 3. Compare current state against baseline
mdoctor compare mdoctor-baseline.json

# Exit code 2 is returned on critical regressions / severe health drop; exit code 0 on pass!
```

---

### Extension Architectural Risk & Impact Scoring

Rank extensions by runtime drag, checkout hot-path interception, around plugin stack depth, minutely crons, and AST cost indicators:

```bash
mdoctor modules --impact
```

---

### Forensic Uninstall Blast-Radius Analysis

Before disabling or removing an extension, check whether other active modules depend on it via `<sequence>`, and see which custom tables or columns will be orphaned:

```bash
mdoctor module Vendor_Feed --uninstall-impact
```

---

### Architecture Diagram Export (Mermaid.js)

Generate visual diagrams of any extension's touchpoints, plugins, observers, and tables directly into GitHub Markdown or Mermaid Live Editor:

```bash
mdoctor module Vendor_Feed --graph mermaid
```

---

### GitHub Action & CI Integration

Automate Magento health checks and pull request reviews using the official GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Magento Doctor Audit

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: nemke82/magento-doctor@main
        with:
          command: scan
          format: sarif
          output-file: results.sarif
          fail-on: critical

      - name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3

```

### Investigating Rules (`mdoctor explain`)

Every diagnosis is backed by factual evidence and transparent heuristics. View the complete engineering explanation and manual verification SQL queries:

```bash
mdoctor explain MD-PERF-021
```

```text
N+1 Repository Access in Collection Loop [MD-PERF-021]

WHAT IS THIS?
A repository load (e.g. $productRepository->getById()) is executed inside a foreach/while loop over a collection.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Calling getById() inside a loop causes Magento to execute a fresh database query (and multiple EAV joins) for every single item in the collection. For 1,000 items, this triggers 1,000 distinct SQL queries instead of 1 batched query.

HOW DETECTION WORKS
Tree-sitter PHP AST analysis walks the syntax tree, tracks loop depth, and flags member call expressions on repository instances within loop blocks.

POTENTIAL FALSE POSITIVES
Very low. In rare cases, a loop with a hardcoded limit of 1 or 2 iterations might trigger a warning.

MANUAL VERIFICATION
Inspect the flagged source file and line number. Enable MySQL query logging or Magento DB profiler during that execution.

REMEDIATION
Add required attributes directly to the parent collection using ->addAttributeToSelect(), or use SearchCriteriaBuilder with an 'in' filter to load all required entities in one round-trip.
```

## Diagnostic Snapshots

Need to share diagnostic state with team members, hosting support, or attached to a GitHub issue? `mdoctor snapshot create` exports a complete, sanitized representation of the store:

```bash
mdoctor snapshot create --output customer_audit.mdoctor
```

You can then inspect the snapshot on any machine without access to the customer's server:
```bash
mdoctor snapshot analyze customer_audit.mdoctor
```

---

## Safety & Confidentiality Guarantees

- **Zero Exposure of Secrets**: Database passwords, crypt keys, Redis passwords, RabbitMQ credentials, and authorization headers are never logged, printed, or saved. The normalized model maps them strictly as `SecretValue::Present` or `SecretValue::Missing`.
- **Safe Read-Only Operations**: All default collectors run non-locking, read-only queries with strict timeouts. Intrusive operations (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) require explicit opt-in.
- **100% Local & Air-Gapped**: Zero telemetry, zero external network calls, zero AI API dependencies. Your code and database metadata never leave your infrastructure.
